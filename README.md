# HTML Album Cover

## Learning Goals


You may not have encountered the `span` tag before, so if you are curious, take
a moment to [read up on some reference material] to better understand its use.

Open `index.html` in a separate browser tab to see your progress on the Album
Cover as you build it.

Run `npm test` to make sure you've met all the deliverables and passed the
tests.

## Conclusion

A lot of the formatting in this lab is done using CSS, or Cascading Style
Sheets, a language that defines styling for HTML. Before we can get to more
elaborate styling, though, it is important to have a strong understanding of
HTML fundamentals.

In this lab, we've tested that understanding by having you practice applying
headers, image, and paragraphs. Completing this lab means that you have a solid
foundation that we can build upon as we continue to learn about web development.

_Clap along if you feel_ you're getting the hang of HTML!
